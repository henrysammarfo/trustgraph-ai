# TrustGraph - Pitch Deck Content

## Slide 1: Cover
**TrustGraph**
Real-Time Trust Monitoring for AI Agents

*Tagline: Know if your AI agent can be trusted, before it's too late*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**AI Agents Are Managing Billions, But Who's Watching Them?**

- AI agents now handle $2B+ in crypto transactions daily
- 47% of DeFi protocols use autonomous agents
- **Zero real-time trust monitoring exists**
- One rogue agent can drain millions in seconds

**The Gap:** We trust AI agents with our money, but have no way to monitor if they're trustworthy.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**TrustGraph: Real-Time AI Agent Trust Monitoring**

- **Live blockchain monitoring** across all chains
- **AI-powered behavioral analysis** using GPT-4
- **Trust scores (0-100)** updated in real-time
- **Instant alerts** for suspicious activity
- **Historical trend analysis** to predict risks

*Like a credit score for AI agents, updated every second*

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

1. **Connect** - Add your AI agent's wallet address
2. **Monitor** - We track every transaction across chains
3. **Analyze** - AI analyzes patterns, calculates trust score
4. **Alert** - Get notified of anomalies instantly
5. **Decide** - Make informed decisions about agent trustworthiness

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Moralis, Alchemy, OpenAI GPT-4, WebSocket, PostgreSQL
